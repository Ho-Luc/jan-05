This asks three questions and give backs responses. The new branch includes a counter to track right answers, better ways to recognize user responses, and uses a loop to guess a number.


Updated Readme, January 8th:

These are the updates to Luc's page that I've made.  I put his first three questions into and array and then called on this array with a function.  We also put a final loop into his final question.

Further Update!!!!!

Added coloring according to correct and incorrect answers.  Also added some additional CSS styling.
